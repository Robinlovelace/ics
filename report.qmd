# Underpinning research

The Propensity to Cycle Tool (PCT) for England and Wales has continued to be the main tool for cycle network planning in England and Wales, but has limitations that we have addressed in subsequent work.
To tackle the issue that networks generated by the PCT were too sparse, due to use of population weighted centroids as the origin and destination points for trips, we developed a new method called 'jittering' [@lovelace2022].
The PCT only considered trips for commuting and travel to school but transport planners require estimates of potential changes based on all trip purposes, leading to the development of new methods for simulating social, leisure and shopping trips and incorporating them into estimates of cycling potential in the CRUSE tool, which is now in use across the Republic of Ireland [@lovelace2024].
To address the limitation that the methods omitted cycling as part of multi-modal journeys involving public transport, we worked with colleagues at the University of Lisbon to calculate cycling potential to public transport links [@f√©lix2025].
