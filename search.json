    "text": "The development of open-source tools and methodologies for strategic active travel network planning has revolutionized transport planning practices internationally. Building on the success of the Propensity to Cycle Tool (PCT) in England and Wales, our research has enabled evidence-based active travel planning across multiple countries and continents. The tools and methods have been adopted by transport planners, policy-makers, and advocacy groups internationally, influencing significant active travel infrastructure investment.\nOur work has: - Enabled cost-effective planning of active travel networks internationally - Been adopted by transport agencies in multiple countries - Supported the development of national and regional active travel strategies - Empowered advocacy groups and civil society organizations globally - Influenced international transport policy and funding frameworks\n\n\n\n\n\nOur research established a replicable, open-source framework that can be adapted to different national contexts, data availability, and transport cultures across:\n\nEurope: Multiple countries implementing adapted methodologies\nAsia-Pacific: Transport agencies adopting evidence-based planning approaches\n\nNorth America: Cities and regions implementing strategic network planning\nGlobal South: Emerging implementations in developing contexts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur research established a replicable, open-source framework that can be adapted to different national contexts, data availability, and transport cultures. The methodology includes:\n\nScalable geographic analysis: From street-level to national-scale planning\nScenario modeling: Multiple future scenarios including “Go Dutch” and e-bike adoption\nMulti-modal integration: Combining cycling, walking, and public transport planning\nHealth and environmental co-benefits: Quantifying broader societal impacts\n\n\n\n\n\nTraining workshops for transport planners internationally\nOpen-access educational materials in multiple languages\n\nCollaboration with international research institutions\nSupport for capacity building initiatives globally\n\n\n\n\n\nOur research program has evolved from national-scale tool development to international methodology transfer and adaptation. Key research developments include:\n\nCultural and Context Adaptation: Methods for adapting PCT methodology to different transport cultures and infrastructure contexts\nData Harmonization: Techniques for working with diverse international datasets and data quality levels\nPolicy Translation: Framework for translating evidence into policy-relevant recommendations across different governance systems\nImpact Evaluation: Methods for measuring the effectiveness of evidence-based active travel planning\n\n\n\n\nSee the research slides for detailed evidence of international adoption and the academic report for comprehensive research documentation.\n\nThis impact case study builds on the foundations established by the PCT project and demonstrates how university research can drive global transformation in sustainable transport planning."
