    "text": "1 Summary of the impact\n[Content to be added]\n\n\n2 Underpinning research\nThe Propensity to Cycle Tool (PCT) for England and Wales has continued to be the main tool for cycle network planning in England and Wales, but has limitations that we have addressed in subsequent work. To tackle the issue that networks generated by the PCT were too sparse, due to use of population weighted centroids as the origin and destination points for trips, we developed a new method called ‘jittering’ (Lovelace, Félix, and Carlino 2022). The PCT only considered trips for commuting and travel to school but transport planners require estimates of potential changes based on all trip purposes, leading to the development of new methods for simulating social, leisure and shopping trips and incorporating them into estimates of cycling potential in the CRUSE tool, which is now in use across the Republic of Ireland (Lovelace et al. 2024). To address the limitation that the methods omitted cycling as part of multi-modal journeys involving public transport, we worked with colleagues at the University of Lisbon to calculate cycling potential to public transport links (Félix, Moura, and Lovelace 2025).\n\n\n3 References to the research\n\n\nFélix, Rosa, Filipe Moura, and Robin Lovelace. 2025. “Reproducible Methods for Modeling Combined Public Transport and Cycling Trips and Associated Benefits: Evidence from the biclaR Tool.” Computers, Environment and Urban Systems 117 (April): 102230. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compenvurbsys.2024.102230.\n\n\nLovelace, Robin, Rosa Félix, and Dustin Carlino. 2022. “Jittering: A Computationally Efficient Method for Generating Realistic Route Networks from Origin-Destination Data.” Findings, April, 33873. https://doi.org/10.32866/001c.33873.\n\n\nLovelace, Robin, Joey Talbot, Eugeni Vidal-Tortosa, Hussein Mahfouz, Elaine Brick, Peter Wright, Gary O’Toole, Dan Brennan, and Suzanne Meade. 2024. “Cycle Route Uptake and Scenario Estimation (CRUSE): An Approach for Developing Strategic Cycle Network Planning Tools.” European Transport Research Review 16 (1): 55. https://doi.org/10.1186/s12544-024-00668-8.\n\n\n\n\n4 Details of the impact\n[Content to be added]\n\n\n5 Sources to corroborate the impact\n[Content to be added]"

    "text": "The development of open-source tools and methodologies for strategic active travel network planning has changed transport planning practices internationally. As documented in a 2021 Impact Case Study, the Propensity to Cycle Tool (PCT) in England and Wales has influenced how millions of pounds are invested in active travel infrastructure, leading to more joined-up networks, better cycling conditions, and increased cycling uptake.\nThe purpose of this project is to research the impacts of methods and tools developed at the University of Leeds since then. The research has been used as the basis for the following tools:\n\nThe Norwegian Propensity to Cycle Tool - A study modeling cycling potential in Trondheim and Nord-Jæren using Propensity to Cycle Tool methodology to calculate scenarios for increased everyday cycling.\nCRUSE - The Cycle Route Uptake & Scenario Estimation tool for Ireland, showing cycling trip percentages by county and cycle networks under different scenarios for everyday trips and cycle tourism.\nbiclaR - A cycle network planning tool for the Lisbon Metropolitan Area that shows existing and planned cycling infrastructure alongside modeling cycling trip potential by municipality.\nNetwork Planning Tool for Scotland - A web-based application designed to support strategic cycle network planning and investment decisions, primarily for use by Scottish local authorities.\n\n\n\n\nThe tools have been adopted by transport planners, policy-makers, and advocacy groups internationally, influencing substantial amounts of active travel infrastructure investment. The research project described in this website aims to answer the questions:\n\nWhat tools and methods have been developed, building on the underlying research?\nWho is using the tools and methods?\nHow much has been invested in active travel in general and cycle infrastructure in particular in countries benefiting from the tools and methods?\nWhat proportion of the investment in active travel infrastructure has been influenced by the tools and methods?\nHow have investment and design decisions changed as a result of the tools and methods?\nHow has the research influenced international transport policy and funding frameworks?"
