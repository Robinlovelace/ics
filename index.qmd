# Impact Case Study: Transforming Strategic Active Travel Network Planning Internationally

## Summary of the Impact

The development of open-source tools and methodologies for strategic active travel network planning has changed transport planning practices internationally.
As documented in a [2021 Impact Case Study](https://results2021.ref.ac.uk/impact/847d1191-7f25-46ba-a399-b481125edc8f?page=1), the Propensity to Cycle Tool (PCT) in England and Wales has influenced how millions of pounds are invested in active travel infrastructure, leading to more joined-up networks, better cycling conditions, and increased cycling uptake.

The purpose of this project is to research the impacts of methods and tools developed at the University of Leeds since then.
The research has been used as the basis for the following tools: 

- [The Norwegian Propensity to Cycle Tool](https://norceresearch.brage.unit.no/norceresearch-xmlui/handle/11250/2994058) - A study modeling cycling potential in Trondheim and Nord-JÃ¦ren using Propensity to Cycle Tool methodology to calculate scenarios for increased everyday cycling.
- [CRUSE](https://www.cruse.bike/) - The Cycle Route Uptake & Scenario Estimation tool for Ireland, showing cycling trip percentages by county and cycle networks under different scenarios for everyday trips and cycle tourism.
- [biclaR](https://biclar.tmlmobilidade.pt/index/) - A cycle network planning tool for the Lisbon Metropolitan Area that shows existing and planned cycling infrastructure alongside modeling cycling trip potential by municipality.
- [Network Planning Tool for Scotland](https://www.npt.scot/#/) - A web-based application designed to support strategic cycle network planning and investment decisions, primarily for use by Scottish local authorities.

The tools have been adopted by transport planners, policy-makers, and advocacy groups internationally, influencing substantial amounts of active travel infrastructure investment.
The research project described in this website aims to answer the questions:

- What tools and methods have been developed, building on the underlying research?
- Who is using the tools and methods?
- How much has been invested in active travel in general and cycle infrastructure in particular in countries benefiting from the tools and methods?
- What proportion of the investment in active travel infrastructure has been influenced by the tools and methods?
- How have investment and design decisions changed as a result of the tools and methods?
- How has the research influenced international transport policy and funding frameworks?
