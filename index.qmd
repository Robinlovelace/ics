# Impact Case Study: Transforming Strategic Active Travel Network Planning Internationally

## Summary of the Impact

The development of open-source tools and methodologies for strategic active travel network planning has revolutionized transport planning practices internationally. Building on the success of the Propensity to Cycle Tool (PCT) in England and Wales, our research has enabled evidence-based active travel planning across multiple countries and continents. The tools and methods have been adopted by transport planners, policy-makers, and advocacy groups internationally, influencing significant active travel infrastructure investment.

Our work has:
- Enabled cost-effective planning of active travel networks internationally
- Been adopted by transport agencies in multiple countries
- Supported the development of national and regional active travel strategies
- Empowered advocacy groups and civil society organizations globally
- Influenced international transport policy and funding frameworks

## International Reach and Adoption

### Methodology Transfer
Our research established a replicable, open-source framework that can be adapted to different national contexts, data availability, and transport cultures across:

- **Europe**: Multiple countries implementing adapted methodologies
- **Asia-Pacific**: Transport agencies adopting evidence-based planning approaches  
- **North America**: Cities and regions implementing strategic network planning
- **Global South**: Emerging implementations in developing contexts

## Key Innovations

### Open Source Methodology
Our research established a replicable, open-source framework that can be adapted to different national contexts, data availability, and transport cultures. The methodology includes:

- **Scalable geographic analysis**: From street-level to national-scale planning
- **Scenario modeling**: Multiple future scenarios including "Go Dutch" and e-bike adoption
- **Multi-modal integration**: Combining cycling, walking, and public transport planning
- **Health and environmental co-benefits**: Quantifying broader societal impacts

### International Capacity Building
- Training workshops for transport planners internationally
- Open-access educational materials in multiple languages  
- Collaboration with international research institutions
- Support for capacity building initiatives globally

## Research Underpinning the International Impact

Our research program has evolved from national-scale tool development to international methodology transfer and adaptation. Key research developments include:

1. **Cultural and Context Adaptation**: Methods for adapting PCT methodology to different transport cultures and infrastructure contexts
2. **Data Harmonization**: Techniques for working with diverse international datasets and data quality levels
3. **Policy Translation**: Framework for translating evidence into policy-relevant recommendations across different governance systems
4. **Impact Evaluation**: Methods for measuring the effectiveness of evidence-based active travel planning

## Evidence of Impact

See the [research slides](slides.qmd) for detailed evidence of international adoption and the [academic report](report.qmd) for comprehensive research documentation.
