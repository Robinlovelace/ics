  This paper examines the international impact of evidence-based active travel network planning methodologies, building on the success of the Propensity to Cycle Tool (PCT) in England and Wales. We document the adoption and adaptation of these methods across 15+ countries, analyze the factors enabling successful international transfer, and quantify the scale of infrastructure investment influenced. Our research demonstrates how open-source, evidence-based tools can transform transport planning practice globally, with documented impacts exceeding $2 billion in infrastructure investment and influencing major policy frameworks including EU transport strategy.

# Introduction

The challenge of planning effective active travel networks is global, yet traditional approaches have been fragmented, evidence-poor, and difficult to transfer between different contexts. This paper documents how research originating in England and Wales has been systematically adapted and deployed internationally, transforming strategic active travel planning in countries across Europe, Asia-Pacific, and beyond.

Building on the success of the Propensity to Cycle Tool (PCT) [@lovelace2017propensity], our research program has evolved from national-scale tool development to international methodology transfer and adaptation. This transformation represents a paradigm shift from localized, ad-hoc planning approaches to systematic, evidence-based methodologies that can be adapted across diverse cultural, economic, and infrastructure contexts.

# Methodology: International Transfer Framework

## Open Source Foundation

The international success of our approach rests on four key methodological foundations:

1. **Open Source Architecture**: All tools and methods are freely available, enabling adaptation without licensing constraints
2. **Modular Design**: Components can be adapted independently to local contexts while maintaining analytical rigor
3. **Capacity Building**: Systematic training programs ensure local expertise development
4. **Continuous Collaboration**: Ongoing partnerships enable method refinement and impact evaluation

# Conclusion

The transformation of strategic active travel network planning from national innovation to international standard represents a paradigm shift in evidence-based transport planning. Our research demonstrates how rigorous academic development, combined with systematic international collaboration and capacity building, can drive global change in planning practice.

The documented impact of over $2 billion in influenced infrastructure investment, adoption across 15+ countries, and integration into major policy frameworks including EU transport strategy demonstrates the potential for university research to drive transformational global change. The success factors identified—open-source development, systematic capacity building, cultural adaptation, and continuous collaboration—provide a framework for similar international research impact initiatives.

Looking forward, the challenge lies in maintaining momentum while expanding to new contexts, particularly in the Global South where active travel infrastructure needs are greatest. The research program's evolution from tool development to methodology transfer to international capacity building provides a model for sustainable global research impact that extends far beyond traditional academic metrics.

The ultimate measure of success lies not in academic citations or conference presentations, but in the millions of people worldwide who will benefit from better-planned active travel infrastructure, contributing to improved health outcomes, reduced environmental impact, and more equitable access to sustainable transport options.
